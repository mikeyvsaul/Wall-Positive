Wall Positive
======

Wall Positive was inspired by public murals shared within a community, usually found on the side of buildings. At the end of our Software Engineering Immersive cohort, I consider those in my class a new community I'm proud to be a part of, especially as we join the much larger community of software developers. I wanted to create a site where others can leave messages of positivity, or at least messages of what they look forward to.

Visitors to the site can see the messages users have already left on the wall. 

Once someone has signed up or logged in, they can double click anywhere on the wall to add their own message. Users have a choice in determining the orientation of the message, the size of the font, the color of the message, and can choose from 6 different "graffiti" style fonts. Users can have messages overlap on the wall. The messages users create can be edited, with the change of location being added in the future. Users can also delete messages they no longer want or if they want to change the location.
